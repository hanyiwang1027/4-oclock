            She told me I was born at 4 PM, Friday, an autumn afternoon.  
        </p>
        <p>
            She showed me a booklet, neatly kept, but the plastic wrap was 
            already yellowed. 
        </p>
        <p>
            She pointed at the hospital where I was born, every time we drove 
            past the east side of the city.

            I have known many autumn afternoons at 4 PM:
        </p>
        <p>
            tiny yellow flowers dotting the stone bricks of ancient walls and 
            ancient paths;
        </p>
        <p>
            tiny raindrops shrouding the stone animals and stone tombs of the 
            fallen kingdoms;
        </p>
        <p>
            tiny sesame seeds sprinkling down from the saline pastries on a 
            sunlit ceramic plate.
        </p>

        <p>But that autumn afternoon, Friday, at 4 PM, I have never remembered.</p>
        <p>
            Neither had I known the tiny yellow flowers, tiny raindrops, tiny sesame 
            seeds by then…
        </p>
        <p>
            Was it a sunny day or had it been raining for a week?
        </p>
        <p>
            Or it could be both, since it was before me, the logic, the reality,

            Hundreds of thousands of women, hospitals, empty booklets…
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet to be picked,
        </p>
        <p>
            Yet to connect.
